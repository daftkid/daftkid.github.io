PR is [here][pr]{: .btn .btn--success}

Shipped in Prowler version [3.1.5](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/releases/tag/3.1.5).

I have noticed that Prowler returns the error while reading Load Balancers in the account:

{% highlight bash %}
2023-02-07 22:28:12,378 [File: elbv2_service.py:62]     [Module: elbv2_service]  ERROR: cn-northwest-1 -- KeyError[53]: 'DNSName'
{% endhighlight %}

It turned out that Gateway Load Balancer does not have such fields as `DNSName` and `Scheme` and Prowler was catching a `KeyError` exception while trying to build a LB object.

Made these fields optional and added some conditions - and voila, it works now.

# Lessons learned

## Check underlying SDK

Despite the fact that LBs are fixed now and Prowler is able to process GWLB correctly, there is still an issue with reading a list of LB Listener's rules for GWLB listener.

The interesting part here is that it's totaly fine to get/describe the Listener by its ARN, however AWS API (and boto3 consequently) returns an `ListenerNotFound` error while trying to get/describe Listener rules by Listener's ARN.

For me it seems like a limitation of AWS API in regards to GWLB Listener rules but it should be somehow processed in `boto3`. I have raised an [issue][boto3_issue] for boto3 team about that.
