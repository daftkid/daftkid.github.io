PR is [here][pr]{: .btn .btn--success}

Shipped in Provider version [4.22.0](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/releases/tag/v4.22.0).

Just a small adjustment to allow the usage of `sc1` EBS volume type for EMR cluster instances.

# Lessons learned

## Some issues are really easy to solve

As you can see, this PR is pretty small and simple and it just contains one line addition to `validEBSVolumeType()` function. And that's it! `sc1` type is already added into AWS SDK for GoLang so you just need to allow this value in Terraform resource own functions. As simple as is! ðŸ˜€

## Acceptance tests must be executed!

Acceptance tests must be always executed before going into a release.

In this PR I have updated test definition to use additional EBS volume of type `sc1` for spinning up EMR cluster and I set volume size to `10Gb`. During the tests it turned that minimal volume size of type `sc1` is `125Gb`. So it was changed to minimal value.

That's how you can learn not really obvious things about some AWS resources.
