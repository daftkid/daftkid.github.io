Shipped in Prowler version [3.1.5](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/releases/tag/3.1.5).

It turned out that VPC endpoint reosource of `GatewayLoadBalancer` does not have `policy_document` attached to it thus this field value is set to `None`.

`vpc_endpoint_connections_trust_boundaries` check was not able to parse field of `None` that's why it just failed with the error:

{% highlight bash %}
2023-02-07 18:36:25,881 [File: check.py:307] 	[Module: check]	 ERROR: vpc_endpoint_connections_trust_boundaries -- TypeError[13]: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
{% endhighlight %}

# Lessons learned

Not too many, just another simple Python code fix.
