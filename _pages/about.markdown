Welcome to my personal Tech Blog!

My name is **Oleksandr Mykytenko**, I'm 27 and I live in Ukraine so far.

I'm really passionate about practicing different technical things such as Cloud Architecture, Systems and Software Engineering.

In my day-to-day work I'm extensively using `AWS`, `Terraform`, `Terragrunt` and other tools that are related to Automation in Cloud and Infrastructure-As-Code (`IaC`).
Also, I'm playing and working with `containers` (`Kubernetes`, `AWS ECS`, `AWS EKS`) and `CI/CD` tools such as `Jenkins`, `GitLab CI`, `ArgoCD` etc.

In my free time I'm studying a lot of different things such as `GoLang`, `design patterns`, `OS`, `databases`, `security` topics and others.

In order to practice new knowledge, I'm contributing into open source projects: [My Contribution to Open Source][opensrc].

Here in the blog I'd like to share some *thoughts*, *practical examples* from my real projects (both own and commercial)
and just keep all my *notes* in one place.

**All information and examples provided in this blog are free for use, and you can (and SHOULD ðŸ˜€) use them when you need it.**

In case you need to contact me, please use links below my Avatar image on the left side.
