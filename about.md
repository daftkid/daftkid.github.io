Hello world!

My name is `Oleksandr Mykytenko` and I'm a tech guy working as a Systems Engineer and living with technology and automation in my heart.

Just created this blog space to share some interesting thoughts, tips and even ideas.

I'm striving to touch all of the possible technologies and I'm not talking only about IT. I'm pretty interested in programming, physics, robotics, modelling, culinary and many other great subjects.

Welcome all of you guys as my readers to my space.
